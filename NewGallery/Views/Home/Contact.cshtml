   <h3><b>About us:</b></h3>
    M.A.N.S Gallery is located in a white cube space in Tel Aviv, at the heart of an emerging industrial and cultural area.
    Since opening their doors in 2019, M.A.N.S Gallery has become a prominent part of the growing local and national art scene.
    M.A.N.S Gallery’s curatorial approach is based on a deep vision and desire to bridge interactions between artists, collectors, and their audience.
    Each show is conceived as an inventive project that balances a selection of emerging and mid-career artists along with established ones, whose practices deserve contextualization.
    Through solo exhibitions and curated group shows, the gallery continually creates an invigorating theoretical discourse around its shows,
    both at home and on an international level, by inviting guest curators to contribute to their vision of the program.

    The gallery was founded by Michal Rotenberg and Shoval Raphael Currently owned and managed by Asaf Weitzman and Nir Abadi.
